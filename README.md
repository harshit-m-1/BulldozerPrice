In this notebook, we aim to predict the sale price of bulldozers using machine learning algorithms. The project involves analyzing the characteristics of bulldozers and utilizing historical sale data to forecast future prices accurately.

Problem Definition:
Our objective is to predict the future sale price of a bulldozer based on its features and past sales data. By understanding the factors influencing bulldozer prices, we can develop a model to estimate their market value.

Data:
The dataset for this project is sourced from the Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition. It includes three main files:

Train.csv: This training set contains data up to the end of 2011.
Valid.csv: This validation set includes data from January 1, 2012, to April 30, 2012. Predictions made on this set are used to generate the public leaderboard during the competition.
Test.csv: This test set, released in the last week of the competition, comprises data from May 1, 2012, to November 2012. The final rank in the competition is determined based on the performance on this set.
Evaluation:
The competition uses the Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMSLE) between the actual and predicted auction prices as the evaluation metric. Our goal is to build a machine learning model that minimizes the RMSLE, thereby improving the accuracy of our price predictions. For more details on the evaluation process, refer to the Kaggle competition overview https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview/evaluation.

Features:
Kaggle provides a detailed data dictionary describing all the features in the dataset. This information is available in a Google Sheets document https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18ly-bLR8sbDJLITkWG7ozKm8l3RyieQ2Fpgix-beSYI/edit?usp=sharing, which can be referenced for an in-depth understanding of the variables used in our analysis.

By leveraging this dataset and applying machine learning techniques, we aim to create a robust model for predicting bulldozer sale prices, contributing valuable insights to the construction equipment market.
